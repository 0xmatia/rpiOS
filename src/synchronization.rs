/// Another way of looking at it: If we wanted to have a global object we would probably use `static`. But this is useless
/// if we can't modify the object's state, so we would change the object to `static mut`. The problem is rust can't guarantee
/// the static object won't be used it multiple threads at the same time, which will cause data races. Because of this, any access
/// to *static mutable* item is unsafe.
/// https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/static-items.html
/// Wrapping it in a lock may help (core:cell:Cell?). In the case of my RpiOS, the lock function doesn't really do anything beside
/// calling get on the object in an unsafe block. In the future, where multithreaded will be used, the lock function will probably use
/// atomic operations or whatever, to ensure exclusive access to the data.
